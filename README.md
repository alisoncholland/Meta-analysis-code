# ${1:Meta-analysis-code}

## First, if you're not sure what a meta-analysis is, or if the bullet points below make no sense, you can find everything you need here: 
## https://alisonhollandblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/my-meta-analysis-code-thank-you-r/

## This meta-analysis code will do the following:

## 1. Convert effect sizes (t-statistics & F-statistics) into correlation coefficients r
## 2. Aggregate effect sizes per study
## 3. Calculate the summary (overall) effect size and heterogeneity
## 4. Check for publication bias and outliers in your data
## 5. Conduct a moderator analysis to see which factors influence the summary effect size


# Installation

## I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. Once R is up and running, download the CRAN packages MAc (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MAc/index.html), metafor (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/index.html), and dplyr https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html.


# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
